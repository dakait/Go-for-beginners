# Go-for-beginners
This repo contains basic go programs to help beginners understand it better. You can download go programming package from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

I invite git users to contribute to this repo in form of small go programs that are easy to understand. Please do not add anything that is already present. To contribute create a new folder with a README.md and a go file. Please specify what your go code does in the README.md file inside your folder.

You can add programs as simple as:
* Add two numbers
* Check if number is prime
* Find factorial of a number
* Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion 

Or some useful codes such as:
* Sorting algorithms
* String manipulation
